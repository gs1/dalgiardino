<p>When we say that Dal Giardino is the true taste of Italy we really mean it. All our food is grown in the rolling hills of Tuscany according to Dal Giardino's strict rules about quality, sustainability and care for the local environment.</p>
<p>We're proud to know all our farmers personally and they all welcome visitors to their farms to see where the Dal Giardino story begins.</p>
