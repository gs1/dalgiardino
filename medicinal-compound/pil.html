<p>We'll drink a drink, a drink<br>To Lily the Pink, the Pink, the Pink<br>The saviour of the human race<br>For she invented, medicinal compound<br>Most efficacious in every case<br><br>Mr. Freers, had sticky out ears<br>And it made him awful shy<br>And so they gave him medicinal compound<br>And now he's learning how to fly<br><br>Robert Tony, was known to be bony<br>He would never eat his meals<br>And so they gave him medicinal compound<br>Now they move him round on wheels<br><br>We'll drink a drink, a drink<br>To Lily the Pink, the Pink, the pink<br>The savior of the human race<br>For she invented medicinal compound<br>Most efficacious in every case<br><br>Old Ebenezer thought he was Julius Caesar<br>And so they put him in a home<br>Where they gave him medicinal compound<br>And now he's emperor of Rome<br></p>
      
<p>Johnny Hammer, had a terrible st-st-st-st-stammer<br>He could hardly s-s-say a word<br>And so they gave him medicinal compound<br>Now's he's seen, but never heard<br><br>We'll drink a drink, a drink<br>To Lily the Pink, the Pink, the Pink<br>The saviour of our human race<br>For she invented, medicinal compound<br>Most efficacious in every case<br><br>Aunty Milly, ran willy-nilly<br>When her legs they did recede<br>So they rubbed on medicinal compound<br>Now they call her Milly Pede<br><br>Jennifer Eccles, had terrible freckles<br>And the boys all called her names<br>But they gave her medicinal compound<br>Now he joins in all the games<br><br>We'll drink a drink, a drink<br>To Lily the Pink, the Pink, the Pink<br>The savior of our human race<br>For she invented, medicinal compound<br>Most efficacious in every case</p>
<p>Lily the Pink, she turned to drink<br>She filled up with paraffin inside<br>And despite her medicinal compound<br>Sadly pickled Lily died<br><br>Up to heaven her soul ascended<br>All the church bells they did ring<br>She took with her medicinal compound<br>Hark the herald angels sing<br><br>We'll drink a drink, a drink<br>To Lily the Pink, the Pink, the Pink<br>The saviour of our human race<br>For she invented, medicinal compound<br>Most efficacious in every case</p>
